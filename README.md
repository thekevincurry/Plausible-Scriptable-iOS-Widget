3. In Scriptable create a new script, copy the code and give the script a name
4. Create a new Scriptable widget in iOS (Any Size will work Medium and Large look best)
5. Select the script you created in step 2, select "Run Script" for When Interacting and for Paramated put your domain being tracked at Plausible.io (ie. gearandgrit.com)
